# KN-DISSERTATION
This repository holds scripts form my dissertation figures and analyses

MET_EXPRS relates to gene expression (NOTCH, WNT, ARID1A) and promoter methylation (HOX genes HOPX, ALX and CDX2, and ARID1A) analysis in ovarian tissues

Gene mutation relates to CTNNB1 and ARID1A mutation analysis in relation to gene expression and promoter methylation (in the case of ARID1A) in ovarian tissues

10 gene panel relates to ovarian tissue analysis of 10 genes selected via analysis of TCGA-OV and GTEx ovarian tissue gene expression data

Gene selection from TCGA and GTEx data relates to the analysis of train and test datasets of TCGA-OV and GTEx ovarian tissue RNA seq data (only the scripts with the figures included in the dissertation)
